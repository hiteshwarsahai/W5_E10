	 * This method is the root of the application and from it, the foundations of the application

	 * 
	 * This method queries the environment to determine the size of the window that is at the heart
	 * of the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The method is called with a single parameter that 
	 * specified the Stage object that JavaFX applications use.
	 * 
	 * The method starts by creating a Pane object, calls the GUI to instantiate the GUI widgets 
	 * using that Pane, creates a Scene using that Pane as a window of a size that will fit the
	 * specifics of the system running the application. Once the Scene is set, it is shown to the
	 * user, and at that moment the application changes from a programmed sequence of actions set
	 * by the programmer into a set of actions determined by the user by means of the various GUI
	 * elements the user selects and uses. 
	 * 
	 * @param theStage is a Stage object that is passed in to the methods and is used to set up the
	 * the controlling object for the application's user interface
